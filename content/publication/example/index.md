abstract: In this paper we study various approaches for exploiting symmetries in
  polynomial optimization problems within the framework of semidefinite
  programming relaxations. Our special focus is on constrained problems
  especially when the symmetric group is acting on the variables. In particular,
  we investigate the concept of block decomposition within the framework of
  constrained polynomial optimization problems, show how the degree principle
  for the symmetric group can be computationally exploited, and also propose
  some methods to efficiently compute the geometric quotient.
